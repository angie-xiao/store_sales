## Project Description 

*[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data) to data used in this project.* 

This project is a simplified version of the original [Kaggle contest](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data). Instead of predicting daily sales for each store-product combination, the focus here is to explore the best method in predicting sales of the best selling *per-store-per-product* combination (i.e. `Grocery I` at `store_nbr 44`) to illustrate the steps involved in time series analyses.

Turned out that the (S)ARIMA(X) model(s) built using our manual reading using ACF & PACF plots (after data engineering steps) yielded better results than `auto_arima()`.

The output data format is demonstrated in the table below:

| date | store | product_family | predicted_sales |
| ---- | ----- | -------------- |  -------------- |
| '2017-01-01' | 44 | GROCERY_I | 5,029|
| '2017-01-02' | 44 | GROCERY_I | 4,380|
